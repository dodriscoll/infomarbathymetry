# infomarbathymetry
Webmapping viewer to enable the display and manipulation of bathymetry grids

This is a Webmapping viewer built to display bathymetry data as a colour gradient and a shaded relief layer.  It has the following features:
•	it is a mobile friendly site
•	it is possible to change how the bathymetry data is displayed to suit the users requirements
•	it is possible to analyse the slope and aspect of the bathymetry
•	it is possible to change the settings used for the shaded relief
•	it is possible to get spot depths using geolocation, map clicks and a text file of points

Bathymetry data used in the viewer was collected by the INFOMAR project (formally the Irish National Seabed Survey) which is a project run jointly by the Marine Institute and the Geological Survey of Ireland.

The viewer is built using html, javascript, a javascript library called Leaflet js, and ESRI Leaflet js and jquery. It uses a single ArcGIS Image Service for the INFOMAR Bathymetry data.
